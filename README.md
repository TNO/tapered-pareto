# Tapered Pareto distribution
Python implementation of the exponentially tapered Pareto distribution, for use according to both Scipy and PyMC fashion.

Pending further documentation, examples are found in the notebooks section.

The tapered_pareto package was initially developed for use in the forthcoming publication (2024-KZK):

Evaluating Seismic Potential, In Press in: “GNSS Monitoring of the Terrestrial Environment: Earthquakes, Volcanoes, and Climate Change”, Editors Y. Aoki & C. Kreemer, Elsevier, 2024.

Figures for the Appendix of this publication have been generated with the [2024-KZK.ipynb](/notebooks/2024-KZK.ipynb) Jupyter notebook.
